**Caesar Cipher**
================

A simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm in JavaScript.

**Description**
---------------

This project is a basic implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet.

**Usage**
--------

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter a message in the input field.
3. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm with a shift of 13.
4. Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the message.

**Requirements**
--------------

* A web browser that supports JavaScript.

**Features**
------------

* Encrypts and decrypts messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
* Supports uppercase and lowercase letters.
* Preserves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation).

**Examples**
------------

* Encrypting the message "HELLO" with a shift of 13 results in "URYYB".
* Decrypting the message "URYYB" with a shift of 13 results in "HELLO".
